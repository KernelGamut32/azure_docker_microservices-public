# Lab 01 - [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python)

**NOTE: Use an A Cloud Guru (ACG) Azure Playground for this lab**

1. Login to `acloudguru.com`, navigate to the `Playground` tab, and click the `Start Azure Sandbox` button
1. Right click the `Open Sandbox` button and select to open in an Incognito or InPrivate window (depending on the browser you're using)
1. Use the provided credentials to login to the Azure portal
1. Follow along with the `Flask`, `Azure portal`, and `Azure CLI` sets of instructions within the tutorial
1. If you have access to a local IDE (like Visual Studio Code) and have Python installed, you can test the application locally (optional)
1. Use the `Azure portal` and the `Azure CLI` from `Cloud Shell` to execute all steps other than the local testing steps (`Cloud Shell` will have all required tools already installed)
1. You should not have to wait for the "starting the site" process to complete to access the deployed application
